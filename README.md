# ArcherAssistant

This program is an attemt to create a tool to monitor the progress of my archery skills
The progress is not measured by the number of bullseyes hit, but rather by the following factors:
1. How well your hits are grouped
2. How close they are to the bullseye.

So, the program allows analyzing the average x-y coordinates of hits as well as the standard deviation of these, computed on a specified set of data. (Moving average)
